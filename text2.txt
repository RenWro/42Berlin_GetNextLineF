On the one hand, you let go of everything and you live in the eternal now, because that’s all there is.
See, memory is an illusion; it’s all gone. 
So everything you know about, that makes an impression on you, is no longer there. 
That’s the meaning of māyā. There is only the eternal now. 
There is only the present moment, and never will be anything else. 
Because even what you’re remembering is happening in the present, the memory is in the eternal now, isn’t it? 
See? So it’s all really absolutely here. But, on the other hand, what fun to drag it out! 
And to make it echo, and to get involved, and to fall in love, and to become attached. 
So, the thing is this: it’s just like riding a bicycle. 
It’s a balance trick. 
You suddenly find yourself falling over one way—well, you balance that: 
you turn into that direction and you stay up. 
And so, in the same way, when you find yourself becoming too attached to life, 
you correct that with the realization that there is nothing except the eternal now. 
Then, when you feel it’s alright now—you see, you’re safe again because there’s only the eternal now—once more, 
you go and get attached.

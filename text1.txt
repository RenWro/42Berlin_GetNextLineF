What is fundamentally involved in this system is self-knowledge. 
You see, without resonance, nothing happens. 
If there are no echoes, you can’t hear anything. 
Supposing we get a room in which we blanket all the walls—and blanket the floor, sound-proof it in every possible direction—you can hardly hear anyone talk. 
Because voice requires resonance. 
That’s why people enjoy singing in the bathtub: they suddenly discover they’ve got a good voice. 
Because, suddenly, the bath and the structure of the room which is all non-soundproofed, resonates.
That’s why you use a violin—or a cello, or a base fiddle—[that] has a big wooden structure to make the sound resonant; 
to play back to itself. And that’s why we are all so fascinated with recording things; 
taking photographs, writing them down, and—above all—remembering: it’s a form of resonance.
